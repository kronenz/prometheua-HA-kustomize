# Specification Quality Checklist: Thanos Multi-Cluster Monitoring Infrastructure

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-13
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Content Quality Review**:
- ✅ Specification focuses on deployment outcomes and operational requirements
- ✅ User stories describe infrastructure operator workflows, not technical implementation
- ✅ Requirements specify "what" (deploy components, configure storage) not "how" (specific YAML structures)
- ✅ All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

**Requirement Completeness Review**:
- ✅ Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements are concrete and based on constitution
- ✅ Each functional requirement is testable (e.g., FR-001 can be verified by checking deployment commands used)
- ✅ Success criteria include specific metrics (60 minutes deployment, 30-second log ingestion, 5-second dashboard load)
- ✅ Success criteria are technology-agnostic (focus on operator experience and system behavior, not internal implementation)
- ✅ All user stories have 4 acceptance scenarios in Given/When/Then format
- ✅ Edge cases section identifies 8 failure scenarios and boundary conditions
- ✅ Out of Scope section clearly defines what's excluded
- ✅ Assumptions and Dependencies sections comprehensively list prerequisites

**Feature Readiness Review**:
- ✅ 21 functional requirements (FR-000 to FR-020) map to 6 prioritized user stories
- ✅ User stories cover complete deployment lifecycle: Minikube installation (P0) → storage/ingress (P1) → central cluster (P1) → edge clusters (P2) → logging (P3) → unified dashboards (P3)
- ✅ 15 success criteria (SC-000 to SC-014) provide measurable validation points for feature completion
- ✅ Specification maintains abstraction layer - no Kubernetes YAML, Helm values, or configuration code mentioned

**Overall Assessment**: Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase. All quality gates passed.

**Update 2025-10-13**: Added User Story 0 (P0) for Minikube installation as the first mandatory step. This ensures complete end-to-end deployment from bare nodes to fully operational monitoring infrastructure. Updated edge cases to include Minikube-related failure scenarios.
